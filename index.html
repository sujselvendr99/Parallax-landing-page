    <h2>Information about our beautiful country</h2>
    <p>
      New Zealand's beauty is spectacular and unforgettable.<br><br>

      There are high snow-clad mountains, volcanoes, fiords, rainforests, lakes, beaches, and rolling green pasture.
       Most tourist and recreational areas are only one or two hours' drive from major cities.<br><br>
      
      New Zealand is a multicultural South Pacific nation. Aotearoa is its Māori name. Māori, New Zealand's 
      indigenous population, migrated from Polynesia around 1000 years ago. They comprise 16.5% of New Zealand's 
      population. The majority of New Zealanders are of British and Irish heritage, but other European influences 
      are noticeable. In more recent years a large number of Pacific Islanders have come to live here from countries
       such as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. There are also large numbers of other nationalities, including recent Asian 
       and European immigrants, who make up New Zealand's population. New Zealand covers approximately the same area
        as Great Britain, making it one of the least crowded countries in the world and a haven for peace and 
        relaxation.<br><br>
      
      New Zealanders are friendly, easy-going people. They welcome visitors warmly and are interested in meeting 
      those from other cultures who come to enjoy what New Zealand has to offer.<br><br>
      
      New Zealanders share a passion for the great outdoors.<br><br>
      
      They love going to the beach, swimming, surfing and whale watching in the Pacific Ocean. Many New Zealanders 
      spend time sailing and windsurfing and the more adventurous enjoy the thrills of white water rafting, 
      jet boating and bungy jumping. "Kiwis", as New Zealanders are often known (not to be confused with the 
      luscious brown furry fruit of the same name), also love hiking and walking in the many forests and mountains, 
      fishing, skiing and snowboarding.<br><br>
      
      New Zealand is a sports-oriented country. New Zealanders are renowned for their sporting prowess and passion 
      for rugby, yachting and netball. Most New Zealanders take part in or watch a wide variety of games including 
      cricket, soccer, golf, squash, basketball, badminton, hockey, tennis, cycling, athletics, skiing and snow 
      boarding.<br><br>
      
      New Zealand has a broad-based economy. Our major export products include meat, fish, fruit, dairy products 
      and timber. We also produce an increasing number and range of manufactured goods and are at the forefront in 
      many areas of information technology and in biological and medical research. Tourism and education are also 
      becoming increasingly important to the economy.<br><br>
